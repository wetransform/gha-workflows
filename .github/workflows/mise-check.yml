#
# Mise check workflow
#
# Intended to be run for pull requests.
#
# Conventions:
# - workflow uses mise environment "ci"
# - should have a mise task named "ci:check"
# - if an environment variable IMAGE_NAME is set by mise or the build, a security scan will be performed on the image
#
# Variants:
# - npm: Cache Node.js modules
#
