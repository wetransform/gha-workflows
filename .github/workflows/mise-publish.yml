#
# Mise publish workflow
#
# Intended to be run for branches or version tags (e.g. v1.0.0).
#
# Conventions:
# - workflow uses mise environment "ci"
# - should have a mise task named "ci:publish"
# - the task should use the environment variable PUBLISH_VERSION to determine the version to publish
# - if an environment variable IMAGE_NAME is set by mise or the build, a security scan will be performed on the image
# - if a file docker-bake.hcl is present, the Docker image will be built using docker bake and it should not be built by the mise task;
#   in this case IMAGE_NAME is expected to be a name without tag and tags to build are determined automatically
# - the docker-bake.hcl should have a target named "default", it should inherit from an empty target "docker-metadata-action"
#
# Variants:
# - npm: Cache Node.js modules
